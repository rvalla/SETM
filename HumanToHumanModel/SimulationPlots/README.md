# Simple Epidemic Transmission Models

### Simulating the spread of a human to human transmitted virus

This a model to simulate the effect from actions taken by the authorities in case of
an epidemic outbreak. Is inspired in **COVID-19** pandemic, but you can adapt the variables to represent
another contagious desease.</br>

#### Population visualization

![Population](https://github.com/rvalla/SETM/raw/master/HumanToHumanModel/SimulationPlots/Population/02092020_10K_360d_Opt_1_population.png)

In this chart you can read easily:

- Humans age distribution
- How many *humans* could be symptomatic
- How many *humans* could be asymptomatic
- *Careful factor* distribution
- *Social distance factor* distribution
- *Death risk factor* distribution

#### Simulation visualization

![Simulation](https://github.com/rvalla/SETM/raw/master/HumanToHumanModel/SimulationPlots/Simulations/02092020_10K_360d_Opt_1.png)

In this chart you can read easily:

- Cumulative evolution for *infected humans*, *deaths*, *recovered humans* and *tested humans*
- Actual *Total infected humans*, *Total tested humans* and infections by *urban areas*
- New *infected humans* by day
- Actual *humans in treatment*
- Evolution for *death rate* and *population immunity ratio*

#### Infections visualization

![Infections](https://github.com/rvalla/SETM/raw/master/HumanToHumanModel/SimulationPlots/Simulations/02092020_10K_360d_Opt_1_infections.png)

In this chart you can read easily:

- Incubation periods distribution
- Total illness periods distribution
- How many *infected humans* were tested
- How many *infected humans* died
- How many *infected humans* had symptoms
- How many *infected humans* needed treatment
- *Infection transmission* by time

Alongside *infection transmission*, green area indicates the period during contingency measures were active 
and red bars mark *population behavior improvement*.
