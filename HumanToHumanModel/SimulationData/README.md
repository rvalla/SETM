# Simple Epidemic Transmission Models

### Simulating the spread of a human to human transmitted virus

Here you can view the data which is saved after simulations. All the important data is in these files. They
allows you to study the results from some simulations without needing to run one.

### *.txt
There are lots of random situations during a simulation. Perhaps the *government* was lucky and isolated
the first infected human and the outbreak doesn't occur at all. You can run several simulations with one
configuration (you decide this with *simulationCount* variable in *humantohumanmodel.py*) to check when a
result is an outlier. Each group of simulations has an only text file (named *simulationName.txt*) in which
all the configuration variables are saved.

### /Infections/*_Infections.csv
In these files you can find information about the infections. The data is saved when a human die or get
recovered.


### /Population/*_Population.csv
In these files you can find information about the population when simulation starts.

### /Simulations/*.csv
All the data about the evolution of the simulated outbreak.
