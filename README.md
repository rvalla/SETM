# Simple Epidemic Transmission Models

I created these models to study the spread of a virus and the effects of actions taken by
the authorities.

### Human to Human Model
In this case the virus can be transmitted from one human to another.

### Vector to Human Model
This will be a simulation of a virus that is passed from one human to an animal and then
to a human.
